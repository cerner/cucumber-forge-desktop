# How to Release

**Incomplete at present**

Releasing the project requires these steps:

0. Set the version number in the code
1. BUILD-COMMAND
2. Use a GitHub [project release][github-release-url] to release the project and tag (be sure it follows [semver][semantic-versioning])
3. PACKAGE-COMMAND and/or RELEASE-COMMAND
4. Update `master` to a new minor version
